<!-- Scope: Determines what can see a variable.

--GLOBAL Scope: has no parent, anyone can see it anywhere, and anyone can change it anywhere. Awesome for small programs.
---Dangerous when your program gets big. If it belongs to the window, or is defined outside of all functions, it's global.
---In Python, globals are variables that are alllll the way to the left.

--LOCAL Scope: live INSIDE of FUNCTIONS and are visible and changeable only within and to that function and its child functions. -->


<script>
    // this isn't inside of a function, so it's global:
    var iAmAGlobal = 1;
    console.log(iAmAGlobal);

    // despite its horrible name, this variable isn't global, because it's inside of a function. 
    // Nobody outside of this function can see or do anything with this variable!
    function checkScope(){
        // var iAmAGlobal = 2;
        iAmAGlobal++;
        console.log(iAmAGlobal);
